      <p>I started learning web development around December of 2017 through a few online courses.When i got the hang of html and css, I completed my first project this past May, which was a photography portfolio website for one of my friends</p>

      <p>I'm currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp at Georgia Tech trying to master skills such as Javascript and Jquery, and also trying to learn more skills such as Node.js, React, Firebase and many more.Take a look at some of my work in the portfolio tab but keep in mind that alot of the material is still a work in progress</p>
